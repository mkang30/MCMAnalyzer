# MCMAnalyzer

MCMAnalyzer is a Python3 console program that predicts the outcome of the football league based on 
the previous season's results. The current version allows an analysis of 3 football leagues, and the
base season's choice from the years 2010-2017.
## Launch
To launch MCMAnalyzer run run.py in a console with Python3.
## Decription
This method of probabilistic analysis is based on the ideas of the Monte Carlo Method and ExpG (expected goals scored) model. For the further information refer my research paper [MCMAnalysisPaper.pdf](https://github.com/mkang30/MCMAnalyzer/blob/master/MCMAnalysisPaper.pdf)
